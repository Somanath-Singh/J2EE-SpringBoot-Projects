			            Doctor Of Philosophy (PhD) Program</h4>
			        <p style="text-align: justify;">
			            The department is actively involved in research in all current areas of Computer Science. 
			            The focus of the PhD program is on research training with a high degree of specialization. 
			            The aim of such a training is to make our PhD students very competent in their respective areas, 
			            so that they may be able to take up teaching or research-and-development professions.
			        </p>
			        <h6 style="text-align: justify;">Duration Of The Program</h6>
			        <p  style="text-align: justify;">
			            The residence requirements for PhD program is four or six semesters depending on whether the 
			            student has M.Tech. or B.Tech. degree, respectively.
			        </p>
			        <h6 style="text-align: justify;">Course Requirement</h6>
			        <p  style="text-align: justify;">
			            For PhD students who have an M.Tech. degree, the minimum requirement is that of 144 credits, 
			            out of which at least 36 credits should be through regular post-graduate courses and at least 72 
			            credits should be through research. In case of PhD students holding a B.Tech. degree, the minimum 
			            requirement is that of 216 credits, out of which 36 credits should be through post-graduate courses 
			            and at least 72 credits should be through research. A typical course is considered to be of 9 credits. 
			            All the courses in the PhD program are electives. A list of all computer science courses is available here 
			            <a href="#">(https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/Courses.html)</a>. A large number of electives are 
			            offered in each semester. The exact courses offered will depend on availability of faculty members 
			            in a particular semester.

			        <p  style="text-align: justify;">
			            Please check the <a href="#">Research Areas</a> page to learn more about the interesting work being carried 
			            out by members of the department.

			        <h6 style="text-align: justify;">What A PhD Student Can Expect?</h6>
			        <p  style="text-align: justify;">
			            The department of Computer Science & Engineering at IGIT, Sarang has always been a very open and supportive 
			            department for all its students, and particularly so for the PhD students. There is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, 
			            where faculty and students mix freely. PhD students are respected as much as any faculty member. They have their own 
			            air-conditioned office space, furniture, etc., with a telephone. Each student is given a PC on her/his desk, when they join. 
			            They get office support for photocopying, laser printing, mailing, stationery, etc. They have a say in deciding the books and
			             journals to be bought by the library. They can expect to get travel support to attend conferences. More details on financial 
			             assistantship is given below. In addition, the deparment runs a large number of short-term courses for the industry, in which 
			             PhD students have a choice to teach. If they choose to teach those courses, they will be given additional handsome remuneration for that.
